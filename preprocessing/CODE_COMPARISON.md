# Code Comparison: Original vs Parallel

## Key Differences Explained

### 1. Sequential vs Parallel Execution

#### Original (Sequential)
```python
for table in tables:
    export_table(database, table)  # One at a time
    create_table(database, table)  # One at a time
    import_table(database, table)  # One at a time
```

#### Parallel (Concurrent)
```python
# Export all tables in parallel
with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=16) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(export_table, db, t) for t in tables]
    results = [future.result() for future in as_completed(futures)]

# Import all tables in parallel  
with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=16) as executor:
    futures = [executor.submit(import_table, db, t) for t in tables]
    results = [future.result() for future in as_completed(futures)]
```

**Impact**: 16 tables now processed simultaneously instead of one by one.

---

### 2. INSERT vs INSERT IGNORE

#### Original (Fails on Duplicate)
```python
insert_sql = f"INSERT INTO `{table}` ({col_names}) VALUES ({placeholders})"
cursor.executemany(insert_sql, batch)
# ERROR 1062: Duplicate entry '123' for key 'PRIMARY'
# Script stops completely ❌
```

#### Parallel (Skips Duplicate)
```python
insert_sql = f"INSERT IGNORE INTO `{table}` ({col_names}) VALUES ({placeholders})"
cursor.executemany(insert_sql, batch)
# Duplicate: Silently skipped, continues with rest ✅
# No error, script continues
```

**Impact**: Can re-run script multiple times safely. Existing data preserved, only new data added.

---

### 3. Progress Tracking

#### Original (Minimal)
```python
print(f"Exporting {table}...")
# No progress indication during long operations
# User doesn't know: 10% done? 90% done? Stuck?
```

#### Parallel (Real-time)
```python
with tqdm(total=len(tables), desc="Exporting", unit="table") as pbar:
    for future in as_completed(futures):
        result = future.result()
        pbar.write(f"✓ {table}: {rows:,} rows")
        pbar.update(1)

# Output:
# Exporting: 78%|████████▎  | 39/50 [05:23<01:32, 0.12table/s]
#   ✓ flights: 1,234,567 rows
#   ✓ airports: 50,000 rows
```

**Impact**: Users see real-time progress, can estimate completion time.

---

### 4. Resume Capability

#### Original (No Resume)
```python
# Always exports, even if CSV exists
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM `{table}`")
with open(csv_path, 'w') as f:
    writer.writerows(cursor.fetchall())
    
# Always imports, even if table has data
load_data_infile(table, csv_path)
# Re-importing causes duplicate errors
```

#### Parallel (Smart Resume)
```python
# Skip export if CSV exists and not forced
if not force and Path(csv_path).exists():
    return {'status': 'cached', 'rows': None}

# Skip import if table already has rows
conn = connect_local_mysql(database)
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute(f"SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `{table}` LIMIT 1")
if cursor.fetchone()[0] > 0 and not force:
    return {'status': 'already_loaded', 'rows': existing_count}

# Use INSERT IGNORE so duplicates are skipped anyway
```

**Impact**: Can interrupt and resume anytime. No wasted work.

---

### 5. Batch Inserts

#### Original (Row-by-row or LOAD DATA)
```python
# LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE - all or nothing
load_sql = f"LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '{csv}' INTO TABLE `{table}` ..."
cursor.execute(load_sql)
# If any row fails, entire file fails
```

#### Parallel (Controlled Batches)
```python
BATCH_SIZE = 5000
batch = []

for row in csv_reader:
    batch.append(row)
    
    if len(batch) >= BATCH_SIZE:
        # Insert 5000 rows at once
        cursor.executemany(insert_sql, batch)
        conn.commit()
        batch = []
        
# Better error handling, better memory control
```

**Impact**: 
- Better memory usage (don't load entire file)
- Can handle huge files
- Better error recovery

---

### 6. Shell Script: Parallel Table Loading

#### Original (Sequential)
```bash
for table in region nation part supplier customer orders lineitem; do
    load_data_file tpch_sf1 "$table" "${file}.tbl"
done
# Takes: 15 minutes + 20 minutes + 8 minutes + ... = Total 70+ minutes
```

#### Parallel (Background Jobs)
```bash
# Load multiple tables simultaneously
load_tpch_table part "${file}.tbl" &
load_tpch_table supplier "${file}.tbl" &
load_tpch_table customer "${file}.tbl" &
load_tpch_table orders "${file}.tbl" &

wait  # Wait for all background jobs to complete
# Takes: max(15, 20, 8, ...) = ~20 minutes with overlap
```

#### Parallel (GNU Parallel - Even Better)
```bash
# Automatic job scheduling and load balancing
parallel -j 8 load_tpch_table ::: part supplier customer orders
# Optimal scheduling, better resource utilization
```

**Impact**: Multiple tables load simultaneously. Time = longest table, not sum of all.

---

### 7. Large Table Splitting

#### Original (Monolithic)
```bash
# Load entire lineitem table as one operation
# File: 6 million rows, 5GB
load_data_file tpch_sf1 lineitem lineitem.tbl
# Takes: 20 minutes, single-threaded
```

#### Parallel (Split and Parallel)
```bash
# Split large file
split -l 1000000 lineitem.tbl lineitem_part_
# Creates: lineitem_part_aa (1M rows)
#          lineitem_part_ab (1M rows)
#          ...

# Load parts in parallel
parallel -j 8 load_tpch_table lineitem ::: lineitem_part_*
# Each part loads simultaneously
# Takes: ~5 minutes with 8 workers
```

**Impact**: 4x faster on large tables. Scales with CPU cores.

---

### 8. Duplicate Handling in Shell Script

#### Original (INSERT)
```bash
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'data.tbl'
INTO TABLE `lineitem`
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' ...
# If row exists: ERROR 1062
# Script exits
```

#### Parallel (REPLACE)
```bash
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'data.tbl'
REPLACE INTO TABLE `lineitem`  # Changed!
FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' ...
# If row exists: Updates it
# If row is new: Inserts it
# No error, continues
```

**Impact**: Re-running script safe. Can update existing data.

---

### 9. Worker Pool Management

#### Original (No Pooling)
```python
# Single-threaded
for table in tables:
    process_table(table)
# Uses 1 CPU core only
```

#### Parallel (Process Pool)
```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor

MAX_WORKERS = min(cpu_count() * 2, 16)

with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=MAX_WORKERS) as executor:
    futures = {
        executor.submit(process_table, table): table 
        for table in tables
    }
    
    for future in as_completed(futures):
        result = future.result()
        # Process result
        
# Uses all CPU cores
# Automatic work distribution
# Exception handling per worker
```

**Impact**: Full CPU utilization. 16-core system does 16x work simultaneously.

---

### 10. Connection Management

#### Original (Reuse Connections)
```python
# Single connection for everything
self.conn = mysql.connector.connect(**config)

for table in tables:
    cursor = self.conn.cursor()
    # Use same connection
```

#### Parallel (Connection Per Worker)
```python
def process_table(table):
    # Each worker gets its own connection
    conn = mysql.connector.connect(**config)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Do work
    
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    # Connection closed when done

# Parallel execution
with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
    executor.map(process_table, tables)
    # Each table gets its own connection
    # No connection contention
```

**Impact**: No connection blocking. MySQL handles multiple connections efficiently.
