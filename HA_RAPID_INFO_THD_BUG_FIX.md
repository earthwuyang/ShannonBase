# ha_rapid::info() - Bug #5: Stale THD Pointer Crash

**Date**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED - REBUILT AND INSTALLED**

---

## Executive Summary

Fixed critical null pointer dereference bug in `ha_rapid::info()` that was causing server crashes during query optimization when using `use_secondary_engine = FORCED`. The bug occurred because the handler was using a stale/cached THD pointer instead of getting the current thread's THD.

**File**: `storage/rapid_engine/handler/ha_shannon_rapid.cc`
**Function**: `ha_rapid::info(unsigned int flags)` (Line 210-231)
**Root Cause**: Using cached `m_thd` instead of `ha_thd()` to get current THD
**Impact**: Server crashes during query optimization for ALL queries with FORCED secondary engine

---

## Bug Discovery

After disabling CTE queries to work around Bug #4 (INDEX_RANGE_SCAN), the server STILL crashed with a completely different crash location:

```
Thread 425 "connection" received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.
0x00005555569b16bb in thd_sql_command()

#0  thd_sql_command()                     ← CRASH: THD pointer invalid
#1  thd_is_query_block(THD const*)
#2  ShannonBase::Transaction::begin()     ← Trying to start transaction
#3  ShannonBase::ha_rapid::info()         ← Getting table statistics
#4  Table_ref::fetch_number_of_rows()
#5  JOIN::init_planner_arrays()           ← During query optimization
#6  JOIN::make_join_plan()
#7  JOIN::optimize()
```

**Key Observation**: Crash happens during **query optimization** (not execution) when trying to get table statistics with `use_secondary_engine = FORCED`.

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem Flow

1. **Handler Construction**: `ha_rapid` constructor sets `m_thd = ha_thd()` (current THD at construction time)
   ```cpp
   ha_rapid::ha_rapid(handlerton *hton, TABLE_SHARE *table_share_arg)
       : handler(hton, table_share_arg), m_share(nullptr), m_thd(ha_thd()) {}
   ```

2. **Query Optimization**: Later, during optimization, `JOIN::optimize()` calls `Table_ref::fetch_number_of_rows()`

3. **Get Statistics**: `ha_rapid::info()` is called to get table row count
   ```cpp
   int ha_rapid::info(unsigned int flags) {
     // ...
     context.m_trx = Transaction::get_or_create_trx(m_thd);  // ❌ m_thd is STALE!
     context.m_trx->begin();
   ```

4. **Transaction Begin**: `Transaction::begin()` calls `thd_is_query_block(m_thd)`
   ```cpp
   m_trx_impl->auto_commit =
       m_thd != nullptr &&                              // ✓ Passes (not null)
       !thd_test_options(m_thd, ...) &&                // ✓ Passes
       thd_is_query_block(m_thd);                      // ❌ CRASHES!
   ```

5. **Crash**: `thd_is_query_block()` → `thd_sql_command()` tries to access `m_thd->lex->sql_command` but `m_thd` points to stale/invalid memory

### Why m_thd is Stale

The THD pointer cached at handler construction time becomes invalid because:
- **Thread context changes**: Handler created in different context than optimization
- **Handler reuse**: Handler objects may be reused across multiple queries
- **Connection recycling**: THD objects can be deallocated/reassigned
- **Optimization threading**: Optimization may run in different thread context

---

## The Fix

**Location**: `storage/rapid_engine/handler/ha_shannon_rapid.cc:210-223`

**Before** (Lines 210-218):
```cpp
int ha_rapid::info(unsigned int flags) {
  ut_a(flags == (HA_STATUS_VARIABLE | HA_STATUS_NO_LOCK));

  std::string sch_tb;
  sch_tb.append(table_share->db.str).append(":").append(table_share->table_name.str);

  Rapid_scan_context context;
  context.m_trx = Transaction::get_or_create_trx(m_thd);  // ❌ Using cached m_thd
  context.m_trx->begin();
```

**After** (Lines 210-223):
```cpp
int ha_rapid::info(unsigned int flags) {
  ut_a(flags == (HA_STATUS_VARIABLE | HA_STATUS_NO_LOCK));

  std::string sch_tb;
  sch_tb.append(table_share->db.str).append(":").append(table_share->table_name.str);

  // BUG FIX: Use ha_thd() to get current THD instead of cached m_thd
  // m_thd is set at handler construction and may be stale/invalid when info() is called
  // during query optimization. This was causing SIGSEGV in thd_sql_command() -> Transaction::begin()
  THD *current_thd = ha_thd();

  Rapid_scan_context context;
  context.m_trx = Transaction::get_or_create_trx(current_thd);  // ✅ Using current THD
  context.m_trx->begin();
```

**Key Change**: Use `ha_thd()` to get the **current** thread's THD instead of relying on the cached `m_thd` from construction time.

### Last Query Before Crash

From `general.log`:
```sql
-- Connection 68 at 2025-10-24T05:27:34
SET SESSION use_secondary_engine = FORCED;
SET SESSION max_execution_time = 60000;
SET optimizer_trace='enabled=on';

SELECT L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID.Description,
       MAX(L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID.Code) AS max_L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID_Code,
       STDDEV(L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID.Code) AS stddev_L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID_Code,
       COUNT(L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID.Code) AS count_L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID_Code,
       SUM(L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID.Code) AS sum_L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID_Code
FROM L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID
WHERE (L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID.Code < 10000000 OR L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID.Code IS NULL)
  AND L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID.Code != -999999
GROUP BY L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID.Description
```

This is a **simple aggregation query** with no CTEs - confirming that disabling CTEs didn't fix the crashes.

---

## Impact Assessment

### Severity: **CRITICAL**

**Frequency**:
- 100% of queries when `use_secondary_engine = FORCED`
- Happens during query optimization (before execution)
- Affects ALL query types (not just CTEs)

**Trigger Conditions**:
- Any query with `use_secondary_engine = FORCED`
- Handler object reuse across queries
- Query optimization phase needs table statistics

**User Impact**:
- ❌ **Complete failure** of FORCED secondary engine mode
- ❌ Data collection impossible with `use_secondary_engine = FORCED`
- ❌ Training data collection blocked
- ✅ OFF mode still works (primary engine only)
- ✅ ON mode may work (if optimizer doesn't choose Rapid)

---

## Testing

### Expected Behavior After Fix

1. ✅ Server starts successfully
2. ✅ Queries with `use_secondary_engine = OFF` work
3. ✅ Queries with `use_secondary_engine = FORCED` work
4. ✅ Query optimization completes without crashes
5. ✅ Data collection with `collect_dual_engine_data.py` succeeds

### Test Queries

```sql
-- Test 1: Simple aggregation (crashed before fix)
SET SESSION use_secondary_engine = FORCED;
SELECT Description, MAX(Code), COUNT(*)
FROM L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID
WHERE Code < 10000000
GROUP BY Description;

-- Test 2: Complex join (should work now)
SET SESSION use_secondary_engine = FORCED;
SELECT On_Time_On_Time_Performance_2016_1.DepartureDelayGroups,
       L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID.Description,
       MIN(On_Time_On_Time_Performance_2016_1.TaxiIn),
       COUNT(*)
FROM On_Time_On_Time_Performance_2016_1
LEFT JOIN L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID
  ON On_Time_On_Time_Performance_2016_1.OriginCityMarketID = L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID.Code
WHERE On_Time_On_Time_Performance_2016_1.DepTime IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY On_Time_On_Time_Performance_2016_1.DepartureDelayGroups,
         L_AIRPORT_SEQ_ID.Description
HAVING COUNT(*) > 6;

## Prevention Guidelines

### Rule: Always Use ha_thd() for Current THD

**Bad** (caching THD):
```cpp
class MyHandler {
  THD *m_thd;  // ❌ Cached at construction

  MyHandler() : m_thd(ha_thd()) {}  // ❌ May become stale

  void some_method() {
    use_thd(m_thd);  // ❌ Using stale pointer
  }
};
```

**Good** (always get current):
```cpp
class MyHandler {
  THD *m_thd;  // ⚠️ Only for methods that know context is stable

  MyHandler() : m_thd(ha_thd()) {}

  void some_method() {
    THD *current_thd = ha_thd();  // ✅ Get current THD
    use_thd(current_thd);          // ✅ Always safe
  }
};
```

### When to Cache vs Get Current

**Safe to cache** (single-use context):
- Methods called in same thread/context as construction
- Short-lived operations with no context changes
- Example: `write_row()`, `update_row()`, `delete_row()`

**Must get current** (optimization/statistics):
- Methods called during query optimization
- Handler methods called across different query contexts
- Statistics gathering: `info()`, `records_in_range()`
- Any method that may run in different thread context
