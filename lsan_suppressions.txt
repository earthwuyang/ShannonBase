# LeakSanitizer Suppressions for ShannonBase
# Add suppressions only after confirming they are not related to the crash

# Example suppressions (commented out - start without suppressions):
# leak:my_thread_global_init
# leak:_dl_allocate_tls
# leak:call_init.part.0

# To add a suppression:
# 1. Run with ASAN_OPTIONS containing print_suppressions=1
# 2. Copy the suppression entry from ASan output
# 3. Paste here and uncomment
# 4. Re-run test to verify suppression works
