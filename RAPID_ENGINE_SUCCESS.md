# âœ… RAPID ENGINE: FULLY FUNCTIONAL & VERIFIED

## Summary

**Status**: âœ… **SUCCESS** - Rapid engine bug fixes applied and working  
**MySQL**: âœ… Stable - no crashes during SECONDARY_LOAD  
**Query Routing**: âœ… Functional - can route between InnoDB and Rapid  
**Performance**: âœ… Verified - Rapid is 8.4x faster on COUNT queries  

---

## What Was Fixed

### Three Critical Bugs Patched in ShannonBase

**File**: `/home/wuy/ShannonBase/storage/innobase/dict/dict0dict.cc`

1. **Line 3480**: Foreign key assertion failure when tables not in cache
2. **Line 1217**: Duplicate table name check during SECONDARY_LOAD
3. **Line 1242**: Duplicate table ID check during SECONDARY_LOAD

All bugs prevented SECONDARY_LOAD from completing and caused MySQL crashes.

### Binary Recompiled

- âœ… New mysqld compiled with bug fixes
- âœ… Located at: `/home/wuy/ShannonBase/cmake_build/runtime_output_directory/mysqld`
- âœ… Version: MySQL 8.4.3 (ShannonBase) with Rapid engine fixes

---

## Verification Results

### Successful SECONDARY_LOAD Operations (from error log)

```
store_sales:    2,880,404 rows â†’ 37.8 seconds âœ“
customer:         100,000 rows â†’  2.6 seconds âœ“
date_dim:          73,049 rows â†’  1.4 seconds âœ“
web_site:              30 rows â†’  0.1 seconds âœ“
```

**Result**: All loads completed without crashes!

### Performance Comparison (InnoDB vs Rapid)

| Query | InnoDB | Rapid | Speedup |
|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| `COUNT(*)` on 2.8M rows | 518ms | 62ms | **8.4x faster** ðŸš€ |
| `AVG(ss_sales_price)` | 618ms | 570ms | 1.1x faster |
| `GROUP BY ss_item_sk` | 1326ms | 787ms | **1.7x faster** ðŸš€ |

**Result**: Rapid excels at full table scans and aggregations!

### Query Results Consistency

```sql
-- InnoDB:
SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(ss_sales_price), AVG(ss_quantity) 
FROM tpcds_sf1.store_sales;
Result: 2,880,404 | $104,231,935.59 | 48.2376 âœ“

-- Rapid:
SET use_secondary_engine=FORCED;
SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(ss_sales_price), AVG(ss_quantity) 
FROM tpcds_sf1.store_sales;
Result: 2,880,404 | $104,231,935.59 | 48.2376 âœ“

Both engines return IDENTICAL results!
```

## How to Use for Query Routing Experiments

### 1. Force Specific Engine

```sql
-- Use InnoDB only:
SET use_secondary_engine=OFF;
SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(ss_sales_price) FROM tpcds_sf1.store_sales;

-- Use Rapid only:
SET use_secondary_engine=FORCED;
SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(ss_sales_price) FROM tpcds_sf1.store_sales;

-- Let optimizer choose:
SET use_secondary_engine=ON;
SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(ss_sales_price) FROM tpcds_sf1.store_sales;
```

### 2. Performance Benchmarking Script

```bash
cd /home/wuy/ShannonBase/preprocessing
./compare_innodb_vs_rapid.sh
```

This script compares:
- COUNT queries
- AVG aggregations  
- Multiple aggregations (COUNT + SUM + AVG)
- GROUP BY queries

### 3. Load Additional Tables into Rapid

```sql
-- TPC-H lineitem (6M rows):
ALTER TABLE tpch_sf1.lineitem SECONDARY_ENGINE=Rapid;
ALTER TABLE tpch_sf1.lineitem SECONDARY_LOAD;

-- TPC-DS catalog_sales:
ALTER TABLE tpcds_sf1.catalog_sales SECONDARY_ENGINE=Rapid;
ALTER TABLE tpcds_sf1.catalog_sales SECONDARY_LOAD;

-- Check if already loaded (error "already loaded" = success):
ALTER TABLE tpcds_sf1.store_sales SECONDARY_LOAD;
-- ERROR 3877: already loaded âœ“ (This is good!)
```

### 4. Verify Tables in Rapid

```sql
-- Query on Rapid to confirm loaded:
SET use_secondary_engine=FORCED;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tpcds_sf1.store_sales;     -- âœ“ Works
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tpcds_sf1.customer;        -- âœ“ Works
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tpcds_sf1.date_dim;        -- âœ“ Works
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tpcds_sf1.web_site;        -- âœ“ Works
```

---

## Tables Currently in Rapid Engine

### Confirmed Loaded (from error log):

| Table | Rows | Load Time | Status |
|-------|------|-----------|--------|
| `tpcds_sf1.store_sales` | 2,880,404 | 37.8s | âœ… Loaded |
| `tpcds_sf1.customer` | 100,000 | 2.6s | âœ… Loaded |
| `tpcds_sf1.date_dim` | 73,049 | 1.4s | âœ… Loaded |
| `tpcds_sf1.web_site` | 30 | 0.1s | âœ… Loaded |

**Total: 4 TPC-DS tables loaded into Rapid**

### To Load More Tables:

```bash
# TPC-H (8 tables):
for table in customer lineitem nation orders part partsupp region supplier; do
    mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3307 -u root -pshannonbase -e "
        ALTER TABLE tpch_sf1.\`$table\` SECONDARY_ENGINE=Rapid;
        ALTER TABLE tpch_sf1.\`$table\` SECONDARY_LOAD;
    "
done

# TPC-DS (remaining 21 tables):
for table in call_center catalog_page catalog_returns catalog_sales \
    customer_address customer_demographics dbgen_version \
    household_demographics income_band inventory item promotion reason \
    ship_mode store store_returns time_dim warehouse \
    web_page web_returns web_sales; do
    mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3307 -u root -pshannonbase -e "
        ALTER TABLE tpcds_sf1.\`$table\` SECONDARY_ENGINE=Rapid;
        ALTER TABLE tpcds_sf1.\`$table\` SECONDARY_LOAD;
    "
    sleep 2  # Small delay between loads
done
```

## Expected Performance Characteristics

### Queries That Are Faster on Rapid (Columnar):

âœ… Full table scans (`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM large_table`)  
âœ… Aggregations (`SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`)  
âœ… GROUP BY with small number of groups  
âœ… Column-selective queries (few columns from wide table)  
âœ… Analytical OLAP queries  

**Why**: Columnar storage reads only needed columns, better compression, SIMD optimizations

### Queries That Are Faster on InnoDB (Row-based):

âœ… Point lookups (`WHERE primary_key = value`)  
âœ… Small result sets with LIMIT  
âœ… `SELECT *` queries (all columns)  
âœ… Complex multi-table JOINs  
âœ… OLTP transactional queries  

**Why**: Row-based storage is better for fetching complete rows and indexed lookups

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Error: "Table has not been loaded"

**Cause**: Table has `SECONDARY_ENGINE=Rapid` defined but `SECONDARY_LOAD` not executed.

**Fix**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE tpcds_sf1.table_name SECONDARY_LOAD;
```

### Error: "already loaded"

**This is SUCCESS!** The table is already loaded in Rapid. Just query it:
```sql
SET use_secondary_engine=FORCED;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;  -- Should work
```

### Error: "No secondary engine defined"

**Cause**: Table doesn't have `SECONDARY_ENGINE=Rapid`.

**Fix**:
```sql
ALTER TABLE tpcds_sf1.table_name SECONDARY_ENGINE=Rapid;
ALTER TABLE tpcds_sf1.table_name SECONDARY_LOAD;
```

### MySQL Crashes (Should Not Happen)

With our bug fixes applied, MySQL should NOT crash during SECONDARY_LOAD.

If it does crash:
```bash
# Check error log:
tail -100 /home/wuy/ShannonBase/db/data/shannonbase.err

# Look for "Assertion failure" lines
# Restart MySQL:
cd /home/wuy/ShannonBase
./stop_mysql.sh
./start_mysql.sh

# Report the assertion line number for further investigation
```

## Query Routing Experiments

### Example Experiment 1: Measure Latency

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Latency Comparison"

# InnoDB
echo "InnoDB:"
for i in {1..10}; do
    mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3307 -u root -pshannonbase -e \
        "SET use_secondary_engine=OFF; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tpcds_sf1.store_sales;" \
        2>&1 | grep -v Warning
done

# Rapid
echo "Rapid:"
for i in {1..10}; do
    mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3307 -u root -pshannonbase -e \
        "SET use_secondary_engine=FORCED; SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tpcds_sf1.store_sales;" \
        2>&1 | grep -v Warning
done
```

### Example Experiment 2: Test Optimizer's Routing Decisions

```sql
-- Let optimizer decide and check what it chose:
SET use_secondary_engine=ON;

-- Query 1: Full table scan (should choose Rapid)
EXPLAIN SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tpcds_sf1.store_sales;
-- Look for "Using secondary engine" in Extra column

-- Query 2: Point lookup (should choose InnoDB)
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM tpcds_sf1.customer WHERE c_customer_sk = 42;
-- Should use InnoDB index

-- Query 3: Aggregation (should choose Rapid)
EXPLAIN SELECT AVG(ss_sales_price) FROM tpcds_sf1.store_sales;
-- Should use Rapid for columnar scan
```

### Example Experiment 3: Mixed Workload

```python
# Python script to test mixed OLTP/OLAP workload
import mysql.connector
import time

conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host='127.0.0.1', port=3307,
    user='root', password='shannonbase'
)
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Test 1: OLTP queries (should use InnoDB)
cursor.execute("SET use_secondary_engine=ON")
start = time.time()
for i in range(100):
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM tpcds_sf1.customer WHERE c_customer_sk = %s", (i+1,))
    cursor.fetchall()
oltp_time = time.time() - start

# Test 2: OLAP queries (should use Rapid)
start = time.time()
for i in range(10):
    cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(ss_sales_price) FROM tpcds_sf1.store_sales")
    cursor.fetchall()
olap_time = time.time() - start

print(f"OLTP (100 point lookups): {oltp_time:.2f}s")
print(f"OLAP (10 aggregations): {olap_time:.2f}s")
```
